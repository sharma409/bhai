      <section>
        <p>My beautiful brother Ankur is gone. He had been in immense pain, grieving his wife Morgan who died of breast cancer two years ago. In the end, his pain became unbearable and he could not keep himself alive any longer.</p>

        <p>Their son, Kieran, is now living with me, Ila, and our baby, Samayah. As I write this, Kieran is walking around the house, eagerly showing his baby sister to the family.</p>

        <p>I am not ready to write an obituary for my Bhai. Words are too weak, language is too small. There is no way to express how beautiful he was and how much I loved him. I won’t try only to fail. Not yet, anyways.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe the words as I write them. I only know life with my big brother. He is part of the fabric of reality. I don’t know how my family and I are supposed to rebuild reality without him.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>That’s why I made this page. We need help — the kind that only you, specifically, can give. We want to listen to the stories, memories, and moments where he still lives. We want to know Ankur the way you knew him.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>I love the sound of his name. There is so much about him I don’t know. I want to breathe the air that remembers him. If you are reading this and you crossed paths with my brother, even briefly, I want to see and hear from you. No relationship is too ordinary, no interaction is too small, no detail is too trivial. Whatever of him still echoes in you, I want to hear it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>If you can, please come to my parents’ house in Milpitas, CA, where we are staying. We can sit on the floor like Ankur loved to. Come soon if you can, come later if you can’t. Text me at 408-712-0062 and we will find a time. If you are unable to come, send a letter to my parents’ home or to rishiandila@gmail.com.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>For now, we just want to see you and hear you talk about Ankur. In the months and years ahead, there may be other ways you can support us. If you have ideas or ways you want to help, Ila made a <a href="https://forms.gle/qZoyBJ2i6VWVBpzP6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">form</a> you can fill out. We may reach out when the time is right.</p>

        <p>We will hold a memorial in the Bay Area at some point, and anyone whose life he touched will be welcome. If you would like to receive the memorial details and we don’t already have your contact information, please tell us <a href="https://forms.gle/BSwnmsP2udRzRE7Y9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
